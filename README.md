## Learning Objectives

* 



## Outline / Notes

* Included is an Xcode project.
* This lab should have tests.
* I like the idea of exploring the full scope of protocols in this lab and challenging the student to create them using the theme of a Hospital. Where historically, they might tackle the problem of creating the various roles in a Hospital using OOP, I say we go after it using Protocol Oriented Programming where the roles of the Hospital, Doctor, Employee, Nurse, Receptionist, etc etc are designed through protocols then when they have to create the various structs representing these specific roles, they can have them conform to the various protocols.
* This lab doesn't need to have any UI elements to it (but it can if you want to make it pretty or dress it up some to correspond with what they have to do).
* This was a general Idea I had, but feel free to approach this from an entirely different angle. I'm more interested in just having them get used to creating protocols, using extensions and be challenged doing so. The Hospital idea might be too hard, so I'm all ears. We can also provide some functionality where they can jump into a partially completed project.
* I would like for this lab to have tests written using Quick & Nimble. 
* I'm open to discuss ideas you might have for this particular lab at this time.
